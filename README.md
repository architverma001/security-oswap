# SecurityOSWAP and FrontendDashboard

## Overview

This project includes a backend security system and a frontend dashboard. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, incorporating advanced security features to safeguard against common vulnerabilities. The frontend dashboard provides a user interface for monitoring and managing API activities.

## Backend Security (SecurityOSWAP)

### Overview

The backend is designed to provide robust security using the `SecurityOSWAP` class, which includes several security features:

- **CORS Configuration:** Manages Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies.
- **Rate Limiting:** Limits the number of requests to prevent abuse.
- **XSS Protection:** Prevents Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
- **SQL Injection Protection:** Detects and mitigates SQL Injection attempts.
- **Fingerprint Limiting:** Monitors and limits API access based on user fingerprints.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secures endpoints with JSON Web Tokens.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Restricts access based on user roles.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### `oswapSecurity` Class

The `oswapSecurity` module includes the `SecurityOSWAP` class with the following methods:

- `applySecurityMiddleware(options)`: Applies middleware for security settings.
- `preventInjection(req, res, next)`: Protects against SQL Injection.
- `preventXSS(req, res, next)`: Protects against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- `applyRateLimiting(options)`: Implements rate limiting.
- `generateFingerprint(req)`: Generates a unique fingerprint for each request.
- `limitFingerprintAccess(req, res, next)`: Limits access based on fingerprints.
- `monitorEndpoints(req, res, next)`: Monitors and tracks API endpoints.
- `saveSuspiciousApi(data)`: Saves suspicious API activities to the database.
- `checkRole(allowedRoles)`: Role-based access control middleware.
- `authenticateToken(req, res, next)`: JWT authentication middleware.

### API Endpoints

- **GET /allfailedapi**: Retrieves all failed API requests.
- **GET /allsuspeciousapi**: Retrieves all suspicious API requests.
- **GET /allapi**: Retrieves all registered APIs.
- **POST /deleteapi**: Deletes an API by its path.
- **POST /login-admin**: Authenticates an admin and returns a JWT token.
- **POST /redirect**: Sets up redirection from an old API path to a new one.
- **GET /admin**: Admin area endpoint.
- **POST /admin/add**: Adds a new admin.
- **GET /client**: Client area endpoint.
- **GET /public**: Public area endpoint.
- **POST /secure**: Secure area endpoint with role-based access control.

## Frontend Dashboard

### Overview

The frontend dashboard is built using React and provides a user interface for interacting with the backend. It includes features for:

- Viewing API statuses and logs.
- Managing registered APIs and suspicious activities.
- Role-based access to different parts of the dashboard.

### Installation

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure that the backend server is running.
2. Open the frontend dashboard in your browser.
3. Log in with admin credentials to access the full range of features.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
